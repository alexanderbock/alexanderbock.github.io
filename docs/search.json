    "text": "Hello and welcome to my personal homepage. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Immersive Visualization group at Linköping University and the Development Lead for the OpenSpace project. Before this, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Utah’s SCI Institute and prior to this a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow in the Center for Data Science at New York University. This page contains a collection of my various private and professional projects, academical achievements, musings about the development of, various miscellenous items, as well as a curriculum vitæ. The picture shows me together with Charlie Duke after flying him back to his Moon landing location from Apollo 16.\nIn my research during my PhD studies and fellowships, I am studying and using Visualization techniques to generate applications that can make difficult data, for example CT/MRI scans or astronomical datasets, easier to understand for a specific target audience, such as domain experts or the general public. Previous projects covered areas from biomedical simulations, deep-brain stimulation visualizations, urban search and rescue applications, topological analyses used for segmentation of fishes, as well as various astronomical and astrophysical phenomena. This page contains a full list of publications and presentations for the interested reader.\nOpenSpace is an open-source collaborative project that aims at visualizing the entire cosmos. The project is a collaboration between Linköping University in Sweden, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, New York University, and the University of Utah’s Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. The software is used for interactive visualization of astronomical and astrophysical phenomena and has been used in a variety of events. On July 15th, 2015 OpenSpace was used to visualize New Horizon’s flyby at Pluto in an event hosted by the American Museum of Natural History called Breakfast at Pluto. Other projects included visualizations of ESA’s Rosetta spacecraft, as well as planetary renderings on Earth and Mars. The most recent visualization was a live presentation in the Hayden Planetarium providing information about the Sun-Earth connection and the effect of Space Weather on it."

    "text": "This page contains a list of different side projects (mostly programming related) that might be, in some form or another, interesting. Most of them are archived on my GitHub page.\n\n\n{=html}\nThis project is about walking as many of the streets of New York as possible and keeping track of my progress. I started this project after moving to New York in 2017 and wanted to experience as much of the city as possible. The data for this project is collected via a free GPS recorder (GPX Tracker) for my phone whenever I am taking a walk or walking back from the office. The GPX data is first cleaned using an editor (GPX Track Editor) to make the rendering less intensive and then converted into less verbose format that also strips out any timing information for privacy reasons using a Python script. The file is then parsed using JavaScript and rendered using the Google Maps API at the same time.\nPython, JavaScript\n\n\n\n  \nThis is another project of me learning how to use Javascript and the Google Maps API, plotting all the flights that I have taken in my life. The data is using the Google Maps API offline to retrieve longitude, latitude pairs based on the international airport codes and processing these into a data file. That file is parsed in Javascript and rendered using the Google Maps API.\nPython, Javascript\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Python script that was inspired to create after watching a TED talk by Cesar Kuriyama (link). The idea is to be able to easily record one second of video footage every day and create one continuous video from it that captures the memories and thoughts of every day of one’s life. An iPhone app existed at the time to do this editing on the phone, but I was not really happy with the design of the app and didn’t want to be locked to the iPhone for such a long term project.\nThe script I created crawls a Dropbox directory and interfaces with ffmpeg to extract one second for each of the videos in the directory. There is configuration file to determine which second of a longer video to use and whether to apply other transformations (mostly converting portrait into landscape, rotating an image by 180 degrees, and upscaling older videos). It then adds the date of that video (based off the file name) in either white or black text and reencodes all one second videos into one long video. All of the original videos are kept to prevent a quality degredation that would otherwise occur if new frames are added to an existing file. I have been doing this since December 2013 and unfortunately missed many days since, but it is an experience that I can recommend to everyone.\nGitHub, Python\n\n\n\n\nThis project is a combat simulator for the popular strategy board game Axis & Allies. Upon entering the number of units that participate in a battle for each side, the simulator will perform a large number of simulated battles and return the percentage of winning, as well as the amount of IPC damage inflicted on either party. It uses online resources to populate various scenarios that can be played in the free online version of the boardgame, TripleA. This application was the primary reason behind the development, but a decent simulator has since been included in TripleA itself.\nGitHub, C++ with Qt\n\n\n\n This application was designed to support a dungeon master when heading a Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition session. In the application it is possible to add an arbitrary number of enemies and keep track of their original hitpoints, current hitpoints and afflictions. Based off the total and current hitpoints the bloodied stat is signaled, as well.\nGitHub, C++ with Qt\n\n\n\n\nThis Python script is meant to automatically execute every day and will download the current Astronomy Picture of the Day APOD and set it as the desktop background. It currently only supports setting the background picture on Windows using the WIN32 API.\nGitHubGitHub, Python\n\n\n\nThis application is a simple graphing tool for a family tree. It was meant as a way to easily collect information about distant family members an keep all information organized in a custom database format.\nGitHub, C++ with Qt\n\n\n\nThis application was an iOS application on the AppStore used to replace a physical character sheet in Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition. It kept track of stats, skills, afflictions, hitpoints, armor class, powers, and all other important aspects of a character. It has since fallen into disrepair and has been removed from sale in the App Store.\nObjective-C"

    "text": "This page will contain different musings about the development of OpenSpace for which I am responsible as the Lead Developer. As said on the main page, OpenSpace is an open-source, collaborative project that aims at visualizing the entire cosmos. The project is a collaboration between Linköping University in Sweden, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, New York University, and the University of Utah’s Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. The software is used for interactive visualization of astronomical and astrophysical phenomena and has been used in a variety of events. On July 15th, 2015 OpenSpace was used to visualize New Horizon’s flyby at Pluto in an event hosted by the American Museum of Natural History called Breakfast at Pluto. Other projects included visualizations of ESA’s Rosetta space craft, as well as planetary renderings on Earth and Mars. The most recent visualization was a live presentation in the Hayden Planetarium providing information about the [Sun-Earth connection] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDDjcxBP6ag)and the effect of Space Weather on it.\nImages and a selection videos are available on the project homepage as well as on its YouTube page.\nFunding and support for the project is provided by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish e-Science Research Center, the Excellence Centre at Linköping-Lund in Information Technology, as well as NASA under award No NNX16AB93A.\n\n\nOne of the large aspects of the software is high-fidelity rendering of planetary surfaces around the solar system. Examples of available datasets include Earth, the Moon, and Mars among others. {group=“my-gallery”}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the development of OpenSpace, the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has been driving the development of the platform towards supporting the scientists in analyzing and disseminating space weather phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the image projections that were performed with the camera of the New Horizons space craft, we focussed ourselves towards visualizing ESA’s Rosetta mission around the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are some of the initial renderings of the Digital Universe stars combined with the Milkyway background texture that was used for the Dark Universe production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 14th, 2015 the New Horizons space craft finally made its closest approach at Pluto and Charon and acquired lots of images and scientific measurements from the system. During the approach, we organized a worldwide event with around 1000 people watching the events unfold live from within OpenSpace. The event was also live-streamed to YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 14th, 2015 the New Horizons Team’s Pluto Palooza event came to the American Museum of Natural History in New York where we presented our, still ongoing, New Horizons developments to the team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2015 in Denver, USA was the first public view of OpenSpace outside of a tight inner circle. Carter Emmart presented the ongoing developments of OpenSpace to a public in the local planetarium. Since it was also the first time of running OpenSpace outside of the planetarium-comfort zone of the Norrköping Dome and the Hayden, it was quite the challenging experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything looked very different back in February of 2014. These were some of the first renderings using the Power Scaled Coordinates, a concept that was later abandoned for a Dynamic Scene Graph structure."
