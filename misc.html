              This page contains a list of other interesting aspects that I want to share in one way or another.  If you read this page and we meet, any of these topics will be a good conversation starter that could last an entire evening.

              <h4>Rocket League</h4>
              <img src="images/rocket-league.png" align="right" width="128" />Rocket League has been my Esport of choice both for watching and playing for a long time now.  I started playing it basically when I arrived on Steam and have been quite <a href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/76561198025172966">decent</a> at it as well.  For people who don't know the game, it is exactly what you imagine if you combine Football and Cars.  A predecessor made by the same team probably had a more descriptive name: Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Anyways, it's a great sport to get into watching Esports online.

              <h4>Kerbal Space Program</h4>
              <img src="images/kerbal-space-program.png" align="right" width="128"/>At the time of writing, my second most favorite game on Steam.  It is basically "Orbital Mechanics, The Game" with a bit of "Babies first Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation" thrown in for good measure.  As per usual <a href="https://xkcd.com/1356">Randall Munroe</a> probably described it the best.  If you ask me, going RP-0 with Real Scale Solar system is the only way to live (and get very, <b>very</b> frustrated).

              <h4>Productivity</h4>
              <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51TLWMEVT0L._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" align="right" width="128"/>Although the book as aged quite badly, I can still recommend David Allen's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563">Getting Things Done</a> book for everyone.  Combining the ideas of this book with a modern TODO list app (I'm currently using <a href="https://en.todoist.com">Todoist</a> after switching away from <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>) really helps reducing stress levels in addition to increasing productivity.  In addition to that, throw in a bit of <a href="http://www.marinaratimer.com">Pomodoro</a> magic and keep those new tasks coming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

              <h4>Podcasts</h4>
              Listening to podcasts has been another staple of entertainment in my life for quite a long time and it is especially useful here in New York to pass the time on those pesky subway rides.  Some of my recommendations of podcasts are:
              <ul>
                <li><i><a href="http://cppcast.com/">CppCast</a></i>:  A for C++ developers.  Discussion topics range from new and interesting libraries over language features all the way to C++ standard discussions.</li>
                <li><i><a href="freakonomics.com">Freakonomics Radio</a></i>:  One of the two economics-focussed podcasts on my list.  It can be quite enlightening to listen how other people reason about the world and learn interesting facts in the process.</li>
                <li><i><a href="www.thejimquisition.com/category/podquisition">Podquisition</a></i>:  Jim Sterling's (The Jimquisition), Laura K Dale's, and Gavin Dunne's (Miracle of Sound) podcast that is, mostly, about video games and to keep up to date on video game news.</li>
                <li><i><a href="https://www.nodumbquestions.fm">No Dumb Questions</a></i>:  My newest addition from the two-dudes-talking genre of podcasts.  Destin Sandlin (Smarter Every Day) and Matt Whitman (10 Minute Bible Hour) discussing arbitrary topics.</li>
                <li><i><a href="www.npr.org/sections/money">Planet Money</a></i>:  Similar to Freakonomics Radio, an economics-focussed podcast about explaining everyday events and items through the looking glass of economics.</li>
                <li><i><a href="www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b1g3c">50 Things That Made the Modern Economy</a></i>:  A BBC podcast where the title gives everything away.  They cover the 50 biggest inventions that shaped the world around us into what it is today.</li>
                <li><i><a href="99percentinvisible.org">99% Invisible</a></i>:  Roman Mars explaining the design aspects of things that are around us daily but to which we normally don't pay any attention.</li>
                <li><i><a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a></i>:  CGP Grey and Myke Hurley's two-dudes-talking podcast about productivity and their careers.  Very useful to listen to other people talking about their self-employment careers. </li>
                <li><i><a href="www.hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet</a></i>:  Brady Haran and CGP Grey's two-dudes-talking podcast.  This is also about any arbitrary topic, but since both hosts are involved in making Youtube videos, that's one reoccuring topic.</li>
                <li><i><a href="https://getcrookedmedia.com/here-have-a-podcast-78ee56b5a323">Pod Save America</a></i>:  A podcast by four former aides to President Obama, Jon Favreau, Dan Pfeiffer, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor, that discuss the current news and provide their side of the story.</li>
                <li><i><a href="https://trumpconlaw.com">What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law</a></i>:  A second podcast by Roman Mars where he and Professor Elizabeth Joh discuss the current political news through the looking glass of Constitutional Law.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Book recommendations</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><i>Superintelligence</i>:  A book by Nick Bostrom about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence and how it might endanger our future.  This book changed my views on AI by 180&deg;</li>

                <li><i>The Dictator's Handbook</i>:  A great book about understanding politics and scheming in organizations.  The books subtitle "Why Bad Behavior Is Almost Always Good Politics‎" probably says it all.</li>

                <li><i>Failure is Not an Option</i>:  A memoir by Gene Kratz, the flight director responsible for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo era space craft at NASA.</li>
                <li><i>Star Wars: Darth Plagueis</i>:  A book about Darth Plagueis, the master of Darth Sidious and how he got to power. </li>
                <li><i>Mogworld</i>:  Written by Ben, Yahzee, Crowshaw, it is a book about what would happen if an NPC in an MMORPG would become sentient.</li>
                <li><i>Cockpit Confidential</i>:  Adopted from excepts of his blog, Patrick Smith, a pilot, explains common questions that people would have if they sat down with a pilot for a beer or two.</li>
                <li><i>A Man on The Moon</i>:  The book about the moon shot by Andrew Chaikin in which he describes the flights of the Apollo program.  He sat down with all (at the time) living astronauts to get their stories.</li>
                <li><i>Ready Player One</i>:  A book about a dystopian future in which everyone lives in "The Oasis", a fully immersive virtual reality environment and is looking for the ultimate golden ticket.</li>
                <li><i>Elon Musk</i>:  A biography about Elon Musk, covering his entire life until 2016, when this book was written.</li>
