Hello and welcome to my personal homepage. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Immersive Visualization](https://immvis.github.io) group at [Linköping University](https://liu.se) and the Development Lead for the [OpenSpace](https://openspaceproject.com) project.  Before this, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Utah's [SCI Institute](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) and prior to this a [Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow](https://msdse.org) in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/).  This page contains a collection of my various private and professional projects, academical achievements, musings about the development of, various miscellenous items, as well as a curriculum vitæ.  The picture shows me together with Charlie Duke after flying him back to his Moon landing location from Apollo 16.

In my research during my PhD studies and fellowships, I am studying and using Visualization techniques to generate applications that can make difficult data, for example CT/MRI scans or astronomical datasets, easier to understand for a specific target audience, such as domain experts or the general public.  Previous projects covered areas from biomedical simulations, deep-brain stimulation visualizations, urban search and rescue applications, topological analyses used for segmentation of fishes, as well as various astronomical and astrophysical phenomena.  [This](academics.qmd) page contains a full list of publications and presentations for the interested reader.

[OpenSpace](http://openspaceproject.com) is an [open-source](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace) collaborative project that aims at visualizing the entire cosmos.  The project is a collaboration between [Linköping University](https://liu.se) in Sweden, the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/) in New York, the [Community Coordinated Modeling Center](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, [New York University](https://nyu.edu), and the University of Utah's [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](https://www.sci.utah.edu).  The software is used for interactive visualization of astronomical and astrophysical phenomena and has been used in a variety of events.  On July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015 OpenSpace was used to visualize New Horizon's flyby at Pluto in an event hosted by the American Museum of Natural History called [Breakfast at Pluto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEFz5JxLd8w).  Other projects included visualizations of ESA's [Rosetta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap4EgRi_ukM) spacecraft, as well as planetary renderings on [Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3exuifro1aM) and [Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWZAg6qpMlE&t=2580s).  The most recent visualization was a live presentation in the Hayden Planetarium providing information about the [Sun-Earth connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDDjcxBP6ag) and the effect of Space Weather on it.
