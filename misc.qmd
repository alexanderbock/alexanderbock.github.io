This page contains a list of other interesting aspects that I want to share in one way or another.  If you read this page and we meet, any of these topics will be a good conversation starter that could last an entire evening.

## Rocket League

Rocket League has been my Esport of choice both for watching and playing for a long time now.  I started playing it basically when I arrived on Steam and have been quite [decent](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/76561198025172966) at it as well.  For people who don't know the game, it is exactly what you imagine if you combine Football and Cars.  A predecessor made by the same team probably had a more descriptive name: Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Anyways, it's a great sport to get into watching Esports online.

## Kerbal Space Program
::: {.img-float}
![](images/kerbal-space-program.png){style="float: right; margin: 5px; width: 250px"}
:::

At the time of writing, my second most favorite game on Steam.  It is basically "Orbital Mechanics, The Game" with a bit of "Babies first Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation" thrown in for good measure.  As per usual [Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/1356) probably described it the best.  If you ask me, going RP-0 with Real Scale Solar system is the only way to live (and get very, **very** frustrated). Unfortunately, the second version of the game was not great and everything around it seems to be dead now.

## Productivity

:::

Although the book as aged quite badly, I can still recommend David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563) book for everyone.  Combining the ideas of this book with a modern TODO list app (I have been using [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com) for a while now after switching away from [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)) really helps reducing stress levels in addition to increasing productivity.  In addition to that, throw in a bit of [Pomodoro](http://www.marinaratimer.com) magic and keep those new tasks coming.


## Podcasts
Listening to podcasts has been another staple of entertainment in my life for way over a decade at this point and it was especially useful in New York to pass the time on those pesky subway rides.  Some of my recommendations of podcasts are:

## Book recommendations
  - _Superintelligence_: A book by Nick Bostrom about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence and how it might endanger our future.  This book changed my views on AI by 180°
  - _Song of Ice and Fire_: It's the original book series for Game of Thrones.  After the disappointing sixth and seventh season, it's refreshing to go back to the original
  - _The Dictator's Handbook_: A great book about understanding politics and scheming in organizations.  The books subtitle "Why Bad Behavior Is Almost Always Good Politics" probably says it all.
  - _The Martian_: A book by Andy Weir which has since been made into a successful move.  Mark Watney is stranded on Mars after an accident and has to survive the harsh conditions on Mars.
  - _The Expanse Series_: A book series by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck about a realistic and gritty future where space travel through the solar system is possible.  Made into a TV series, too.
  - _Failure is Not an Option_: A memoir by Gene Kratz, the flight director responsible for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo era space craft at NASA.
  - _Star Wars: Darth Plagueis_: A book about Darth Plagueis, the master of Darth Sidious and how he got to power.
  - _Mogworld_: Written by Ben, Yahzee, Crowshaw, it is a book about what would happen if an NPC in an MMORPG would become sentient.
  - _Cockpit Confidential_: Adopted from excepts of his blog, Patrick Smith, a pilot, explains common questions that people would have if they sat down with a pilot for a beer or two.
  - _A Man on The Moon_: The book about the moon shot by Andrew Chaikin in which he describes the flights of the Apollo program.  He sat down with all (at the time) living astronauts to get their stories.
  - _Ready Player One_: A book about a dystopian future in which everyone lives in "The Oasis", a fully immersive virtual reality environment and is looking for the ultimate golden ticket.
  - _Elon Musk_: A biography about Elon Musk, covering his entire life until 2016, when this book was written.
  - _Steve Jobs_: A biography about Steve Jobs, written by Walter Isaacson, and is probably the most complete retelling of his life.
