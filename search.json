I started this project after moving to New York in 2017 and wanted to experience as much of the city as possible. The data for this project is collected via a free GPS recorder (GPX Tracker) for my phone whenever I am taking a walk or walking back from the office. The GPX data is first cleaned using an editor (GPX Track Editor) to make the rendering less intensive and then converted into less verbose format that also strips out any timing information for privacy reasons using a Python script. The file is then parsed using JavaScript and rendered using the Google Maps API at the same time.\nPython, JavaScript"

    "text": "1 second everyday\n\n\n\nThis is a Python script that was inspired to create after watching a TED talk by Cesar Kuriyama (link]). The idea is to be able to easily record one second of video footage every day and create one continuous video from it that captures the memories and thoughts of every day of one’s life. An iPhone app existed at the time to do this editing on the phone, but I was not really happy with the design of the app and didn’t want to be locked to the iPhone for such a long term project.\nThe script I created crawls a Dropbox directory and interfaces with ffmpeg to extract one second for each of the videos in the directory. There is configuration file to determine which second of a longer video to use and whether to apply other transformations (mostly converting portrait into landscape, rotating an image by 180 degrees, and upscaling older videos). It then adds the date of that video (based off the file name) in either white or black text and reencodes all one second videos into one long video. All of the original videos are kept to prevent a quality degredation that would otherwise occur if new frames are added to an existing file. I have been doing this since December 2013 and unfortunately missed many days since, but it is an experience that I can recommend to everyone.\nGitHub, Python"

At the time of writing, this is my most played game on Steam and it is a fantastic game to play while watching some YouTube videos that only require half-attention.\n\n\nRocket League\n\n\n\nRocket League has been my Esport of choice both for watching and playing for many years.. I started playing it basically when I arrived on Steam and have been quite decent at it as well. For a variety of reasons I stopped playing a few years ago, but it is still a great amount of fun! For people who don’t know the game, it is exactly what you imagine if you combine Football and Cars. A predecessor made by the same team probably had a more descriptive name: Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.\n\n\nFactorio\n\n\n\nThis is a real-time automation game where you have to constantly expand your factory to construct more and more elaborate production chains, all while defending everything from the ever-present bugs on the planet. It’s the perfect “Just 5 more minutes” game.\n\n\nKerbal Space Program\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, my second most favorite game on Steam. It is basically “Orbital Mechanics, The Game” with a bit of “Babies first Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation” thrown in for good measure. As per usual Randall Munroe probably described it the best. If you ask me, going RP-0 with Real Scale Solar system is the only way to live (and get very, very frustrated). Unfortunately, the second version of the game was not great and everything around it seems to be dead now."

None of them will be interesting for everyone, but a few might be useful for some. - Obsidian: A (mostly) Markdown file based knowledge database and notes-taking application. While it is possible to synchronize files using their paid service, the software is agnostic to the location of the files and supports Drobox, Google Drive, etc. Basically Notion, but local. - Quarto: A publishing system that converts Markdown and Python code into documents, presentations, or websites (such as this one). - VS Code: Probably the best code editor that is currently around, following in the footsteps of Notepad++ and Sublime Tetx\n\nAutohotkey: A powerful scripting language that execute complex actions through keyboard shortcuts. Almost anything that is doable in Windows can be automated through AHK.\nImageMagick: Image conversion tool that supports almost any image format. Also has tools to edit the images in a procedural manner and is thus very batch-friendly.\nMicrosoft PowerToys: Many features for more advanced users of Windows, such as a better clipboard handling, window management, etc. Would recommend that for anyone using Windows as a working environment.\nMilton: An open-source vector drawing problem that is great for quick drawings when trying to explain complex concepts.\nPandoc: A document conversion tool that supports many file types, being able to generate Word documents from Markdown, PDFs from text files, etc etc.\nParsec: A fantastic remote control application with ultra-low latency and multi-monitor support. More than once I didn’t actually realize that I was watching a video on the remote computer, it’s that great.\nRenderDoc: Anyone who does any OpenGL development needs this frame analyze that allows you to dissect any OpenGL frame and look at the rendering pipeline, textures, etc.\nFork: In my view the best visual interface for Git.\nVLC: Who hasn’t heard of VLC\nOBS: An open-source screen recording software that I have been using for more than a decade at this point.\nSpeedCrunch: A great calculator with support for easy unit conversions, including interactively defining new units.\nvdo.ninja: A swiss army tool of video capturing and sharing. Using WebRTC, it is possible to capture anything and then either include it in OBS as a Browser or share a link with anyone to watch.\nyt-dlp: A great tool to download videos from many video sharing platforms.\nwinget: apt for Windows. Makes it trivially easy to update software using the commandline or setup a new computer with a single line of code to install all software that you would want.\nTodoist: A great light-weight Todo tracking app that has great API interfaces, too."

    "text": "Hello and welcome to my personal homepage. I am currently an Assistant Professor for Immersive Visualization at Linköping University in Sweden and a Visiting Researcher at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Prior to this in 2019-2020, I was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Utah’s Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and from 2017-2018, I was a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow in the Center for Data Science at New York University after finishing my PhD at Linköping University. Since 2013, I am also the Development Lead for the OpenSpace project. This page contains a collection of my various private and professional projects, academical achievements, musings about the development of, various miscellenous items, as well as a curriculum vitæ. The picture shows me together with Charlie Duke after flying him back to his Moon landing location from Apollo 16.\nIn my research during my PhD studies and beyond, I am studying and using Visualization techniques to generate applications that can make difficult data, for example CT/MRI scans or astronomical datasets, easier to understand for a specific target audience, such as domain experts or the general public. Previous projects covered areas from biomedical simulations, deep-brain stimulation visualizations, urban search and rescue applications, topological analyses used for segmentation of fishes, as well as various astronomical and astrophysical phenomena.\nOpenSpace is an open-source, collaborative project that aims at visualizing the entire cosmos. The project is a collaboration between Linköping University in Sweden, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, New York University, and the University of Utah’s Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. The software is used for interactive visualization of astronomical and astrophysical phenomena and has been used in a variety of events. On July 15th, 2015 OpenSpace was used to visualize New Horizon’s flyby at Pluto in an event hosted by the American Museum of Natural History called Breakfast at Pluto. Other projects included visualizations of ESA’s Rosetta spacecraft, as well as planetary renderings on Earth and Mars. Another worthy live presentation in the Hayden Planetarium provided information about the Sun-Earth connection and the effect of Space Weather on it. See the OpenSpace YouTube channel for more examples."
